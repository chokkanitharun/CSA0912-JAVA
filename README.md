Java Swing Login Form
Project Overview
This is a simple Java Swing project that demonstrates how to create a login form with basic user authentication. The form takes a username and password, validates the input, and authenticates the user by checking the credentials stored in a MySQL database. The project uses the Java Swing framework for the GUI and MySQL for the backend database.

Features
Username & Password Authentication: Users can log in using a username and password.
MySQL Database Connection: The login form is connected to a MySQL database, which stores valid credentials.
Error Handling: The form handles incorrect login attempts by displaying error messages.
Technologies Used
Java (Java Swing for GUI)
MySQL Database (for storing user credentials)
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
XAMPP (MySQL server for local database setup)
Prerequisites
Java JDK 8 or above
XAMPP (for running the MySQL server)
MySQL JDBC Driver (Connector/J for Java)
IDE: (Optional) You can use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans to run the project.
